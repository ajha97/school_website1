        consider,canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.Online menus
        with photographs of the meals prepared,and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and 
        parents make right choices.Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a
        School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meals choices and any dietary 
        requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box  and paying for meals online can eliminate
        all the fuss of money handling, making it easier,safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
        Here again,diversity is the key.</p>

      <h4>Implemented Online attendance Managemnt System</h4>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy-        
        Humans are prone to error,environment
        if we provide them with  supporting computational devices.Automated attendance managemnt systems ensure accurate
        time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to
        provide accurate performance  and payroll data.
        <br>
        2. Economics-
        Have you ever thought that attendance managemnt systems could control costs? It saves money  by putting an end
        to inaccurate time reporting ,buddy punching,absentism,tardiness , time abuse ,and overpayment. As a matter of fact
        a study done by the  Axsium Group found that large organisations save upto $1600 per employee after implementing
        automated attendance managemnt systems.
        <br>
        3. Productivity / Efficiency-
        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time consuming ,laborius, and expensive affair. It takes time
        to process paper sheets and time cards creates schedules,authorize leave and overtime,and create payroll manually.
        Free up precious administration time with with an automated system that does it all for you ,from keeping track of
        employee  hours  to automatically importing information into your payroll system .The time and effort saved combined
        with data  accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources  which lead to increased productivity and improves 
        profits and many more like Visibility/Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Managemnt, Flexibility, Integration/
        configuration, Real-time tracking,Security, and Compilance.
